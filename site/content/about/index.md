# About header

Welcome to my Blog " A first contribution to". I would like to figure out and document how a first contribution to an open source project went.

I think about a large set of different projects including ones I am familiar to, ones I at least know about and ones totally new to me. 
The goal would be:
- Figure out how easy it is to contribute
- Document this on the blog and give projects Feedback
- Motivate others to contribute as well

Any feedback? Feel free to reach out to me via mail (simone.p.weiss@posteo.com) or linkedin.
